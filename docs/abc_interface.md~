## Potential structures to keep from abc-smc
- Particles  this structure can be the same for now (particles to params for model output), but this will eventually need to work with MRP 
- Generation  reframe as a population of particles 
- Particle updater  operates at population level 
- Variance adapter  operates at population level 
- Prior distribution  element of experiment controller 
- Perturbation kernels  element of experiment controller in concert with variance adapter 
- Spawn RNG  we do want a method for handling RNGs, this is one option 

```python run_calibration.py
def particles_to_params():
    
def outputs_to_distance():

## This will be substituted by MRP
def model_runner():    


runner = ABCSMC(
    number_of_particles = 100,
    tolerance_values = [10, 5, 1],
    priors = params_priors,
    perturbation_kernels,
    particles_to_params,
    outputs_to_distance,
    target_data = data_df,
    model_runner = model_runner,
    seed = 12354)

runner.run()



```

```python abcsmc
class ABCSMC:
    def __init__(
            number_of_particles,
            tolerance_values,
            priors,
            perturbation_kernels,
            particles_to_params,
            outputs_to_distance,
            target_data,
            model_runner,
            seed):
    ## Do things    

    def run():
        for g in range(G):
            while i < N:
                if g == 1:
                    particle = sample_particle_from_priors()
                else:
                    particle = sample_from_previous_generation(weights)
                    perturbed_particle = perturb_particle(particle)
                    er = calculate_distance(particle)
                if er < d[g]:
                    calculate_weight()
                    population.add(particle)
            normalize_weights()
```
